# Graph Neural Networks (GNN) Learning Repository

A beginner-friendly introduction to Graph Neural Networks with hands-on implementations from scratch using NumPy.

## What's Inside

This repository contains step-by-step tutorials for learning GNNs:

- **Notebook 1**: Introduction to Message Passing
  - Learn how information flows through graphs
  - Understand matrix operations for graph aggregation
  - Build normalized adjacency matrices

- **Notebook 2**: Building GCN from Scratch
  - Implement a complete Graph Convolutional Network
  - Train on Zachary's Karate Club dataset
  - Visualize node embeddings and classification

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Start with Notebook 1** (`01_introduction_to_message_passing.ipynb`)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

See `requirements.txt` for complete list.



## Learning Path

1. **Start here** → Notebook 1: Message Passing Fundamentals
2. **Continue** → Notebook 2: Build and Train a GCN

Each notebook includes:
- Clear explanations
- Step-by-step code
- Mathematical formulations
- Visualizations

## Notes

- All implementations use NumPy (no PyTorch/TensorFlow) for learning purposes
- Code is heavily commented for educational value
- Works with NetworkX 2.6+

## Future Additions

This repository is actively maintained. Planned additions:
- More GNN architectures (GAT, GraphSAGE, etc.)
- Additional datasets and examples
- Exercises and challenges
- Advanced topics (graph-level tasks, graph generation)
